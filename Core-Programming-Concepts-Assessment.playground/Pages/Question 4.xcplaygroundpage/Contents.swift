 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**
 
 */
// Answer question 4 below
var appsUsed = 7
var hoursSpent = 4.5
let mostPopularApp = "YouTube"
let currentDate = "Friday, January 26, 2018"
print("I used Int for appsUsed because that will be a whole number (you can't have half an app). Because we are including the parts of an hour, I decided that double will be easiest to use for hoursSpent. mostPopularApp will be a string because it is the NAME of the app. Current date is also a string because this is the easiest type to use when both letters and numbers are present.")
